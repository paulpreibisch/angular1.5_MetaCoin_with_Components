# Angular 1.5 Truffle Meta Coin With Components 
This repo is a good starting point for angular developers interested in creating
smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.

I previously created [Angular MetaCoin](https://github.com/paulpreibisch/angularMetaCoin) which 
simply wraped the code generated by the [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle)
framework, from their command "truffle init" into an AngularJs application.

After using an Angular 1.5 Generator called [Angular-eggs](https://github.com/albatrosary/generator-angular-eggs#readme)
I decided to implement the same structure they used, but instead, inside of the truffle build framework.
Angular Eggs uses components rather than $scope and Controllers, and since Angular 2 is coming out
word on the street is to start using components as soon as possible instead of directives, controllres, and $scope.

This app therefore modifies my original Angular MetaCoin app so that all the Transaction code and UI is now in a "transactions" component.
The app configuration, and also th home page itself are also in seperate components.

Hopefully, you will find this useful!

Cheers
